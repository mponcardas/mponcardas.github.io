In this step-by-step tutorial, I'll show you how to use the built-in Image Capture app on your Mac to scan and combine multiple documents into a single PDF file. This method eliminates the need for third-party apps and streamlines your scanning process, making it smoother and more efficient.

## Step 1: Open Image Capture app

1. Select your scanner.
2. Click the <kbd>Show Details</kbd> button.
   - This provides an overview of what your scan will look like, allowing you to preview before scanning the actual document.

1. The right-hand panel allows you to adjust your scan settings:
   - **Kind** Choose between color or black and white.
   - **Resolution** Determines scan qualityâ€”higher values means better quality but also increase file size.
   - **Size** Leave as auto or select a standard paper size, e.g., A4.
   - **Orientation** Automatically detects document orientation, but manual adjustments are possible.
   - **Scan To** Choose where your scan will be saved.
   - **Name** Specify the filename of your scanned document.
   - **Format** Choose the desired image format, such as .jpeg, .png, or .pdf for documents.
   - **Combine into single document** Make sure to check itâ€”it's the key step to get all your scans into one file.
2. When you're done adjusting your settings, click the <kbd>Scan</kbd> button

## Step 4: Pop-up window

2. Click the <kbd>Scan</kbd> button again to scan your next document. Repeat this process for multiple pages.
