In the realm of cybersecurity, Social Engineering is defined as "a set of techniques used by cybercriminals to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information, installing malware, or clicking on links to infected sites" (Kaspersky Lab). At its core, social engineering exploits a target's emotional responses and natural tendencies to deceive them into revealing sensitive information (Symantec).

## Summary of use cases

The article entitled ‚ÄúSocial Engineering: The Art of Deception‚Äù by Ir. M.B. Paques CISSP CISA, provided a very clever and insightful real-life use cases of social engineering attacks. It also provided an explanation about what methods or techniques and the tools used in the attack as well as the countermeasures to mitigate the attacks that was just performed. The two case studies that caught my attention was case 1 and 3. 

In Case Study 1, the attack was carried out by two individuals. One distributed a document disguised as a survey link for the company's upcoming Christmas party, while the other acted as a lookout. Before executing their plan, the duo had already conducted in-depth research to identify their potential targets, allowing them to focus on younger employees. These targets were lured into participating in the survey with the promise of a chance to win a raffle. Unbeknownst to the victims, clicking on the fake survey link actually handed their user credentials over to the attackers.

In Case Study 3, the attacker employed a classic social engineering technique known as "tailgating." In this approach, he followed closely behind an employee to gain entry into a restricted facility that typically requires access via key cards. Posing as a co-worker, the attacker first stationed himself in a common smoking area outside the building as a form of disguise. He then struck up a conversation with an employee and seamlessly followed the individual into the building. 

The attacker was able to tailgate through multiple floors, bypassing several areas that required restricted key card access. Once inside, he quickly located a communal office space and conducted reconnaissance on the company's internal network. Ultimately, he harvested numerous employee credentials via a fake intranet website and successfully compromised an administrator account, gaining elevated access privileges within the network. Remarkably, the attacker accomplished all of this in under an hour.

## Trends in Social Engineering

According to the "The Human Factor 2018" report by enterprise security company Proofpoint, cyber-criminals have escalated their operations by leveraging the "human factor" in security through social engineering techniques. The report emphasizes that over the years, threats centered on "people-oriented" attacks have surpassed those relying on automated exploits. Specifically, phishing attacks delivered via email campaigns continue to be the leading attack vector. 

Key findings from the report reveal that typosquatted or suspicious-looking domains outnumber legitimate brand-registered domains by a 20-to-1 ratio. In Web-based attacks, fake browser plugin updates accounted for 95% of social engineering techniques. Around 55% of customer support scams that originated from social media targeted customers of financial services companies. Additionally, clickbaits redirecting users to fraudulent websites containing malware made up about 35% of scams disseminated through social media networks. The report also highlighted that in 2017, the top three targets for phishing attacks were cloud storage accounts, financial institutions, and general email credential harvesting.

In a more recent analysis, the Anti-Phishing Working Group's (APWG) "Phishing Attack Trends Report - 3Q 2018" recorded a total of 151,014 detected phishing attempts in the third quarter of 2018. The most targeted sectors included payment systems, Software as a Service (SaaS), Webmail, and file hosting companies.

## Key Takeaway

Kevin Mitnick, a renowned computer hacker and social engineer, once said, "You could spend a fortune purchasing technology and services, and your network infrastructure could still remain vulnerable to old-fashioned manipulation." Even as cyber criminals increasingly sophisticate their attack methods and employ complex threats, one constant remains in their strategy: exploiting the weakest link in the security chain‚Äîthe human element (Bordessa, 2018). Given this, organizations should pay more attention than ever to the "human factor" in their daily operations. Implementing a cybersecurity education and awareness training program can significantly enhance the protection of valuable business assets.
