Over the years, the diversity of information has grown exponentially, and combined with people's dwindling attention spans, it has become a major challenge to communicate complex statistical data using traditional methods in a way that is understandable to the general public.

Fortunately, fields that rely on scientific data have found creative and clever ways to visualize complex data sets through so-called infographics, a visual representation of information, data, or knowledge designed to present complex information quickly and clearly

## Charts Communicate Better Than Tables of Data

![Whiteboard with writing](https://s6.imgcdn.dev/OL2se.jpg){: width="700"}

In the past, data was mainly presented in tabular form, similar to a spreadsheet. Over time, this method proved difficult to use as the amount of data grew exponentially and complexity increased as well.

In addition, the spreadsheet format requires a person with statistical knowledge to interpret large data sets, which is usually incomprehensible for non-experts to make sense of the information. 

With the continuous flow of data generation, infographics were adopted for mass communication and designed to be easily understood by people regardless of their educational background.

## Here Comes The Charts

William Playfair was a political economist and engineer whose books The Commercial and Political Atlas (1786) and The Statistical Breviary (1801) contain one of the earliest forms of graphical representation of economic data, which ushered the modern use of data visualization.

Playfair is credited with inventing the modern charts and graphs we use today to visualize changes in various types of data over a period of time.

According to Playfair, using data visualization makes it much easier for people to understand numerical or statistical information than the written words traditionally presented in a table format. Playfair's use of graphs and charts eliminated the need for specialized knowledge to understand complex data sets.

## Making Data Accessible

The International System of Typographic Picture Education (ISOTYPE) is a standardized set of pictorial symbols called "pictograms" developed in the early 1920s. 

ISOTYPE was used primarily to visually represent socioeconomic data, with the main principle being "visual literacy" to make complex data accessible to lay people.

![Weekly Earnings of Men and Women 1940](https://s6.imgcdn.dev/Omy6h.png{: width="700"}

ISOTYPE was the result of a collaboration between Otto Neurath, an Austrian sociologist and economist, and Gerd Antz, a German artist.

## Bringing The World to Life, One Infographic at A Time

Infographics use eye-catching and engaging visuals to communicate information quickly and clearly.

Infographics have a wide range of applications, as they can be used practically in many subject areas.

This form of visual communication is becoming increasingly popular these days as it is a way to present content in new, creative ways. The use of infographics has exploded recently as free editing tools are now widely available.

### Business Marketing

Businesses are always looking for new ways to connect with their customers.

![Marketing infographics](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFMJ7jselwJzQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1650576567057?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=mKO90a47DpbygyfXtH-kIBlk8hR3IlVaNmEK-hHU2e0){: width="700"}
_Marketing Infographics: The Definitive Guide (www.venngage.com)_

Nowadays, infographics have become a very popular way to achieve this goal, simply because they are an engaging format. It's another form of storytelling where businesses use images instead of words to convey messages more vividly and quickly than traditional text-based content.

### Product and Service Processes

An infographic can be a better alternative to the typical numbered list of step-by-step processes often used to illustrate product design, service production, or manufacturing procedure.

![Make complex processes seem simple](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFLXtLbsL_o5A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1650576992654?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=435pdUWrETUxMxWqyS3YneFOmI9dGNJCKMZgbCEuwtM){: width="700"}
_Make complex processes seem simple (www.venngage.com)_

A process-type of infographic is an easy way to visually understand the entire process. Use icons, diagrams, and templates so everyone understands what it's all about right away.

### Weather

For many years, meteorologists have used infographics to inform people about the weather.

![Weather forecast in Finland](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHPJUb8asQvXw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1650577047441?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=EIpqL55eWRSjdSscN4ieKpqMQIznnUiPCHgK7eD5FLk){: width="700"}

Icons for sunny, rainy, or windy days can be added to visually emphasize the forecasted weather for a particular day. Temperature changes can also be displayed with the help of graphics.

### History

Infographics can be used to create a timeline to show historical events and important dates in history in a visual way.

![American history at a glance](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHk_Np9B-U7JQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1650577131750?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=WThp3RBE5-IPDB_OdNvttY7yG85ZGPP8vUdBw7QfcXI){: width="700"}

Certain dates in history, especially in books, are usually listed in a fairly long list and don't provide much context to what actually happened on those days.

By using infographics, designers can include images to add more information and make the design more interesting for readers.

### Maps and Wayfinding

Infographic maps use legends through color coding and simple symbols to show location.

![Wayfinding Infographic](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHsizHZYysoKg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1650577458593?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=ajdRnLDodyowPSR2p5L2cpjAt5IhBjNjdnYc8bdbfiU){: width="700"}
_Wayfinding Infographic â€“ APEX (www.bookmarkcontent.com)_

They're very useful for tourists visiting a city to show them where city landmarks and popular destinations are located.

This type of infographic is also known as a wayfinding map and is often used in airports, schools, and other places to help people navigate through an area or location.

### Governments

Governments are finally catching up with the times and using infographics to disseminate statistical data such as censuses, financial budgets and other public information.

![Making time for creative activities](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGfIWVI-T0udw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1650577562098?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=kv9baKYAnn366Q49Qm9xKMYmiCdocyLzdUCB58DZeaY){: width="700"}

The use of infographics in government promotes better transparency by making information more accessible to constituents who may not be well versed in statistics or finance.

### Transportation

It's a quick way to show unfamiliar passengers specific routes and locations of stations.

![Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL)](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHdLfZS4MZvDA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1650577653030?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=QksSPs2hpvCxgeU0N_WUFRa0c9WXxpB_fj7Zlfq3SQA){: width="700"}

Just like wayfinding, infographics are a very useful tool to show commuters which public transportation they need to take, such as trains, busses, and trams, when going to and from certain destination.

## Storytelling with Data

Infographics have seen a huge resurgence in recent years, and the trend continues unabated. Many are now integrating code and design to create a more interactive version of data visualization and immersive experiences by leveraging AR and VR technologies.
